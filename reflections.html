        <h2>Week One - aka. Week Zero</h2>
            <p>Week one flew by! Bootcamp on one hand has been pretty easy because we have had a lot of lectures. On the other hand, being able to apply the information on the homework assignment for this weekend was challenging. We had to design a database, which probably took me about 6 hours to complete, with a lot of "marinating" my thoughts in between. Ultimately, I keep seeing how much I have to learn. I am still learning how to elucidate the questions that I have and using the documentation.</p>
